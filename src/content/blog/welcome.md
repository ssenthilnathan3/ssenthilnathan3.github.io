Welcome! This is the first post on my new blog, and I'm excited to share my thoughts with you.

## What to Expect

This blog will cover a variety of topics that interest me, including:

- **Technology & Engineering** — Deep dives into tools, frameworks, and the craft of building software
- **Research & Ideas** — Explorations of concepts that capture my curiosity
- **Projects** — Retrospectives and lessons learned from things I've built

## Why I Write

Writing is thinking. By putting ideas into words, I'm forced to clarify my thoughts and challenge my assumptions. This blog serves as both a personal knowledge base and a way to contribute back to the community.

I try to write the kind of content I wish existed when I was learning — practical, honest, and focused on the *why* behind decisions, not just the *how*.

## Get in Touch

If anything I write resonates with you, or if you disagree and want to discuss further, I'd love to hear from you. The best ideas emerge from conversation.

Thanks for reading, and I hope you find something useful here.
