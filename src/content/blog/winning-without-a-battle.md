i was literally screaming my lungs out: **"AKAZAAAAA"** with the protagonist.
when **akaza** showed up before **tanjiro** in the Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle Arc movie

but something about their battle made it linger. apart from the mind-blowing efforts that were put in the animation, choreography and the script. there was one thing that stayed.

the battle of someone who perseveres through every obstacle he may face and a demon who *really* knows how to fight and knows every move that the enemy may take who faces him.

to get to the gist we have to understand about the main two people of this battle.

## **who are akaza & tanjiro... really?**

tanjiro is someone who lost his family because of demons. he is given two choices where he has run for the rest of the life and watch his sister die eventually OR he has to become a demon slayer and kill the demons who killed their family, then eventually save his sister.

he has this incredible amount of perseverence, strength and compassion that can't just be defeated by sheer force from the demons.

for akaza, he is someone who wanted to live a normal life instead of staying being a thief. but due to humans being humans, the people he loves also gets killed (by humans). so he turns into a DEMON out of hatred from humans.

i think akaza and tanjiro are just, **polar opposites** - not in strength, but in how they relate to intention.

## **hinokami kagura**

it is a *series of 12 moves* that are performed repeatedly in a night (till sunrise). it is a generational thing. it is an **art form** practiced in tanjiro's family.

when tanjiro knew he couldn't kill akaza just by fighting vigorously and being fast (because he is a demon of third rank), he stopped and thought every experience related to akaza. 

he went through his fight with him before: how he loves the **fighting spirit of the opposite** and how he **predicts the attack** even before it happened

and it hit him. 

*"he is a different animal now" akaza said after.*

tanjiro not only uses the art form as a *breathing technique* but he learns something out of it that defines his fighting itself. what tanjiro really understood is not a way to kill akaza but the **art of war** itself.

## **art of war** - by sun tzu

sun tzu never talked about winning by overpowering the enemy. he talked about something far more unsettling:  
**making the enemy’s strengths unusable.**

akaza is a perfect fighter - as long as there is intent to fight.  
his entire combat philosophy is built on sensing will, reading anticipation, feeding on resistance. he doesn’t react to bodies. he reacts to _signals_.

this is why tanjiro couldn’t defeat him by being faster or stronger. every increase in effort only gave akaza more information.

**hinokami kagura** didn’t give tanjiro new moves. it gave him a new _state_.

a cycle with no wasted motion.  
no anticipatory tension.  
no excess intention.

when tanjiro entered that state, he stopped broadcasting his next move. akaza’s predictive advantage collapsed. not because tanjiro hid something, but because there was nothing to sense.

this is what the art of war means by _winning without battle_.

akaza was still fighting.  
tanjiro had already exited the fight.

and in that silence, power lost its grip.

## **so what??**

*ig most of us fight like akaza. we escalate, we signal, we resist. and sometimes, like tanjiro, the answer isn’t more effort, it’s less noise.*

***the art of war** isn’t about defeating others.* 

*it’s about reaching a state where conflict no longer defines the outcome. that’s what made this battle linger. not the spectacle, but the silence it left behind*
